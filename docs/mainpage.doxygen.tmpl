    @section intro Introduction

    The oracle module provides an Oracle driver to Qore's DBI system, allowing Qore
    programs to take access Oracle databases through the Qore's \c Datasource,
    \c DatasourcePool, and \c SQLStatement classes.

    This module is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL 2.1</a>
    and is tagged as such in the module's header (meaning it can be loaded
    unconditionally regardless of how the Qore library was initialized).

    Example of creating an Oracle Datasource (note that db_encoding, host,
    and port are optional - using the hostname and port allows connections
    to be established without TNS, without these parameters TNS is used):

    @code
    $db = new Datasource(SQL::DSOracle, $user, $pass, $db, $db_encoding, $host, $port);
    @endcode

    This driver supports the following DBI capabilities:
    - \c DBI_CAP_TRANSACTION_MANAGEMENT
    - \c DBI_CAP_STORED_PROCEDURES
    - \c DBI_CAP_CHARSET_SUPPORT
    - \c DBI_CAP_LOB_SUPPORT
    - \c DBI_CAP_BIND_BY_VALUE
    - \c DBI_CAP_BIND_BY_PLACEHOLDER
    - \c DBI_CAP_HAS_EXECRAW
    - \c DBI_CAP_HAS_STATEMENT
    - \c DBI_CAP_HAS_SELECT_ROW
    - \c DBI_CAP_HAS_NUMBER_SUPPORT
    - \c DBI_CAP_HAS_OPTION_SUPPORT

    The \c Datasource::getServerVersion() and \c Datasource::getClientVersion()
    methods are implemented for this driver. \c Datasource::getServerVersion()
    returns a string giving server information similar to the following:

    @code
    Oracle Database 10g Release 10.2.0.1.0 - 64bit Production
    @endcode

    The \c Datasource::getClientVersion() returns a hash giving version
    information in the following keys: \c major, \c minor,
    \c update, \c patch, \c port_update.

    Note: There seems to be a bug in Oracle 9i and earlier in the streaming
    \c OCILobRead() function, where the LOB buffer must be at least twice
    as big as the LOB data to be read. This bug does not affect versions
    of the Qore oracle module linked with Oracle 10g libraries or later.

    @note Object (Oracle named type) and collection support is supplied
    courtesy of \c ocilib (http://orclib.sourceforge.net/), note that
    \c ocilib was highly modified to be usable in this module, mostly
    due to the fact that we use a separate environment data structure for
    each connection to ensure maximum thread scalability - the Oracle docs
    say that all operations on an environment handle or any handle derived
    from an environment handle (i.e. statement handles, etc) must be either
    wrapped in a mutex (when initialized with \c OCI_NO_MUTEX) or will
    be wrapped in a mutex by oracle (with \c OCI_THREADED and
    without \c OCI_NO_MUTEX).

    @section options Driver Options

    When compiled again Qore 0.8.6+ the pgsql driver support the following DBI options:
    - \c "optimal-numbers": return <tt>NUMBER</tt> types as an integer if possible, if not as an arbitrary-precision number
    - \c "string-numbers": return <tt>NUMBER</tt> types as strings (for backwards-compatibility)
    - \c "numeric-numbers": return <tt>NUMBER</tt> types as arbitrary-precision number values

    The default if no other option is explicitly set is \c "optimal-numbers".  Note that this represents a change from previous numbers where Oracle <tt>NUMBER</tt> values were returned as strings in order to avoid the loss of information.  To set the old behavior, set the \c "string-numbers" option when creating the \c Datasource or \c DatasourcePool object.

    Options can be set in the \c Datasource or \c DatasourcePool constructors as in the following examples:
    @code
    my Dataource $ds("oracle:user/pass@db{numeric-numbers}");
    my DataourcePool $dsp("oracle:user/pass@db%host.internal:1521{optimal-numbers}");
    @endcode

    @section bindings_and_types Binding and types
    
    When retrieving Oracle data, Oracle types are converted to Qore types as
    per @ref default_oracle_to_qore_mapping.

    Binding by value is supported for any statement executed through this
    driver; Oracle types are converted to Qore types as per @ref binding_by_value.

    Binding by placeholder is required to retrieve values from a procedure
    or function call. The oracle driver assumes that any placeholder values
    are string values unless a placeholder buffer specification is passed
    in the argument position corresponding to the placeholder specification
    in the string. For placeholder buffer specification values,
    see @ref binding_by_placeholder.

    Oracle \c TIMESTAMP data supports time resolution to the microsecond,
    however Qore's date/time value only supports a millisecond resolution.
    Any Oracle \c TIMESTAMP values are rounded to millisecond resolution
    when converted to Qore data types.

    PL/SQL code and stored procedure and function execution is supported;
    the following is an example of a stored procedure call using bind by
    value and bind by placeholder (the \c %v characters represent the
    positions for binding the arguments following the SQL string by
    value, and the placeholder names are prefixed by a colon):

    @code
    $result = $db.exec("begin h3g_psft_order_import.insert_h3g_psft_customers(%v, %v, :status_code, :error_code, :error_description); end;",
                       "Customer Name", "Customer-ID", Type::Int, Type::Int);
    printf("%N\n", $result);
    @endcode

    This will bind the \c "Customer Name" and \c "Customer-ID" strings by
    value (as per @ref binding_by_value these will be bound with Oracle type
    \c SQLT_STRING), and the output variables will be bound by placeholder
    (the first two will be bound as per @ref binding_by_placeholder with
    buffers of Oracle type \c SQLT_INT, and the last placeholder buffer
    will get the default buffer type of \c SQLT_STRING), resulting in a hash
    giving the values of the output variables:

    @code
    hash: (3 members)
        status_code : 0
        error_code : 0
        error_description : <NULL>;
    @endcode

    @section named_types Named Types (Objects)
    
    Qore Oracle driver supports Oracle objects and collections (NTY in the following text).

    Special initialization of the driver is mandatory to use NTY in Qore scripts:

    @code
    %requires oracle
    @endcode

    This statement imports additional functions for NTY binding and fetching
    and therefore is required in Qore code that wants to use these
    functions - the automatic loading of DBI drivers on reference happens
    at run-time, therefore any references to the functions provided by
    this module can only be resolved at parse time if the module is
    explicitly required as above.

    |!Function|!Description|
    |Qore::Oracle::bindOracleObject()|Binds a Qore \c value as a Object type \c typename. Hash keys are object attributes
    |Qore::Oracle::placeholderOracleObject()|Allows fetching Object type \c typename. The returned hash is a plain Qore hash with keys set as the object's attributes
    |Qore::Oracle::bindOracleCollection()|Binds \c value as a Collection \c typename
    |Qore::Oracle::placeholderOracleCollection()|Allows fetching a Collection \c typename. The returned list is a plain Qore list of values with the collection's type

    Type names (strings) are case insensitive.
    
    Key names in \c value hashes are case sensitive and should follow
    Oracle uppercase naming convention. 

    Keys which are not found in the keys-attribute mappings are silently
    ignored. If there is a missing key for any attribute, an exception is thrown.

    Functions can be nested so there can be for example list (collection)
    of objects and vice versa:

    Sample named types defined in the DB:

    @code
    CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE test_object
        AUTHID current_user AS OBJECT
    (
        attr_num number,
        attr_varchar varchar2(20)
    );
    CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE test_collection IS TABLE OF test_object;
    @endcode

    Example of binding NTY:

    @code
    my hash $obj1 = ( "ATTR_NUM" : 1, "ATTR_VARCHAR" : "lorem ipsum" );
    my hash $obj2 = ( "ATTR_NUM" : 2, "ATTR_VARCHAR" : "dolor sir amet" );
    my list $l = ( bindOracleObject('test_object', $obj1),
                   bindOracleObject('test_object', $obj2) );
    $db.exec("begin test_pkg.foo(%v); end;", bindOracleCollection('test_collection', $l));
    @endcode

    Example of fetching NTY:

    @code
    my $res = $db.exec("begin test_pkg.get_obj(:retval); end;",
                       placeholderOracleObject("TEST_OBJECT"));
    printf("%N\n", $res);
    
    # will print out
    hash: (
        "ATTR_NUM" : 5,
        "ATTR_VARCHAR" : "foobar!"
    )
    @endcode
    
    @warning Oracle Named Types (objects and collections) are custom data types
        stored directly in the Oracle system catalogue. They are real SQL
        types - created with \c CREATE \c [ \c OR \c REPLACE \c ] \c TYPE
        command. It's a common misundrestanding that PL/SQL types created
        for example in package specification can be used as NTY too, however this is an
	incorrect assumption.  PL/SQL types cannot be used directly with the Oracle \c OCI
        library, however you can use custom wrappers or any other workarounds, of course.

    @section known_issues Known Issues

    Unfortunately there are some known bugs in the Oracle Module which cannot be fixed
    in the Qore driver right now. These are bugs in the underlying Oracle C Interface
    (OCI) library mostly.

    - Bind by placeholder using PL/SQL's \c type alias to \c CHAR does not use original dimension.
    @code
    CREATE TABLE t1 ( c CHAR(1) );
    INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('C');
    COMMIT;

    create or replace procedure foo(tmp out t1.c%type)
    is
    begin
        select c into tmp from t1 where rownum < 2;
    end;
    /
    @endcode
    @code
    my Datasource $d("oracle", "test", "test", "test");
    on_exit $d.rollback();
    my any $r = $d.exec("begin foo(:outchar); end;", Type::String);
    printf("%N\n", $r);

    Result:
    hash: (1 member)
    outchar: "C

    - Returning a collection of objects and Oracle client 10.x does not work correctly sometimes.
      There is only one instance of object (a first one) used for all items in the
      collection in some cases. Upgrade to Oracle client 11.x solves it.

    - Binding a collection of objects can lose VARCHAR2 attribute values replacing
      them with NULL. This behavior has been observed on Solaris SPARC architecture
      using Oracle CLient 11.1.x. Upgrading to 11.2.x solves the issue.

    - Oracle Metalink Bug #3604465 - bind named type by placeholder can cause
      \c ORA-21525 (attribute number or (collection element at index) %s violated
      its constraints) if the object contains numbers with size constraint. An example:

    @code
    TYPE a_object AS OBJECT (
        my_num1 number(3), -- it will cause ORA-21525
        my_num2 number     -- it will work
    )
    @endcode

    - A crash when is the \c placeholderOracleObject() used in the place
      where is the \c placeholderOracleCollection() expected by Oracle.
    
    @code
    my any $res = $db.exec("begin test_pkg.get_collection(:retval); end;",
                           placeholderOracleObject("test_object"));

    # there is an exception expected: OCI-21710 but following crash appears:
    OCI-21500: internal error code, arguments: [kgepop: no error frame to pop to], [], [], [], [], [], [], []
    OCI-21710: argument is expecting a valid memory address of an object
    @endcode

    @section releasenotes Release Notes

    @subsection oracle22 oracle Driver Version 2.2

    <b>New Features and Bug Fixes</b>
    - fixed bugs in named type support - when an unknown named type is accessed for the first time, ocilib keeps an invalid entry for the named type in the type list; the second time the type is accessed, a crash results (bug reported and already fixed in upstream ocilib)
    - fixed memory bugs in handling named type bind parameters created by hand where the value type is incorrect
    - now the driver throws an exception if SQLStatement::fetchRow() is called before SQLStatement::next() (before it would return garbage data)
    - supports the arbitrary-precision numeric type in qore 0.8.6+
    - supports DBI options with qore 0.8.6+; options supported:
      - \c "optimal-numbers": return <tt>NUMBER</tt> values as an integer if possible, if not as an arbitrary-precision number
      - \c "string-numbers": return <tt>NUMBER</tt> values as strings (for backwards-compatibility)
      - \c "numeric-numbers": return <tt>NUMBER</tt> values as arbitrary-precision number values
    - the default is now "optimal-numbers" - meaning that numeric values are retrieved as <tt>int</tt> if possible, otherwise as a <tt>number</tt> type is returned.\n
      For backwards-compatibility, set the \c "string-numbers" option to return <tt>NUMBER</tt> values as strings
