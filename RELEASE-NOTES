***********
version 1.2
***********

when compiled against qore >= 0.8.0, the driver supports:
* Datasource::execRaw(), DatasourcePool::execRaw()
* time zones in date/time values (binding and retrieving)
* time resolution to the microsecond (binding and retrieving)


***********
version 1.1
***********

fixed memory error in streaming c/blob retrieval (double free)
print a warning statement if debugging is enabled if OCI_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO is
returned by Oracle
bind character values greater than 30K bytes long as a CLOB
fixed a bug setting the port number for direct connections witout TNS


*************
version 1.0.9
*************

fixed auto-reconnect to mark the datasource as closed when auto-reconnect 
fails; otherwise a crash can occur when the datasource is reused


*************
version 1.0.8
*************

when compiled with qore module API 0.7 or greater (qore >= 0.7.5), the module
supports making direct connections without TNS by using the hostname and port
set in the Datasource or DatasourcePool object

updated query parsing for '%*' placeholders to ignore '%' characters when they
are preceded by an alphanumeric character in order to avoid having to use
backslashes to escape them in PL/SQL code, for example


*************
version 1.0.7
*************

updated to allow input and output variables to be bound for stored procedure
and function calls for types: string, binary, integer, float, date

fixed binary binding and retrieving in stored procedure and function calls

fixed backquoting ':' characters


*************
version 1.0.6
*************

updated to allow result sets and nested tables, etc to be returned directly
fixed a bug calculating memory for character buffers; memory was calculated as
the square of the memory actually needed


*************
version 1.0.5
*************

fixed a bug raising invalid handle exceptions; the exception description
contained a random series of bytes instead of string data


*************
version 1.0.4
*************

updated configure to check the directory specified with --prefix first when
looking for dependent libraries

fixed instant client detection from 32-bit RPMs (again)


*************
version 1.0.3
*************

* made default to use SQLT_FLT bindings because using SQLT_BDOUBLE with Oracle
  9i or earlier will not work


*************
version 1.0.2
*************

* fixed detection of Oracle instant client installed from 32-bit RPMs


*************
version 1.0.1
*************

* fixed compilation with Oracle 9i
* fixed setting buffer sizes for retrieving SQLT_STR data when the server's
  character encoding uses a smaller maximum number of bytes per character than
  the encoding for the connection


***********
version 1.0
***********

* implemented auto-reconnect for the Oracle driver; if the connection
  disappears while not in a transaction, then the driver will automatically
  and transparently try to reconnect the connection


- all earlier versions were bundled with the qore library


**********
Qore 0.6.2
**********

added support for the following types:
TIMESTAMP* types
INTERVAL* types
BINARY_FLOAT
BINARY_DOUBLE
UNSIGNED INT
RAW
LONG RAW

Qore date/time types are now bound as TIMESTAMP value to preseve milliseconds
when possible (for both binding by value and binding by placeh
older).  Milliseconds are preserved in all TIMESTAMP* and INTERVAL DAY TO
SECOND types.

Timezone information is discarded when converting from Oracle types to Qore
types, as Qore's date/time type does not yet support timezone information.


**********
Qore 0.5.2
**********

the select() and selectRows() methods both support binding data directly in
queries with the same syntax as with exec(), for example:

my $result = $oradb.select("select * from table where value = %v", $value);


**********
Qore 0.5.1
**********

Oracle driver fixed to not throw parse exceptions when the ":" character is
not followed by an alphabetic character 

so ":=" is legal in SQL statements again :-)


**********
Qore 0.5.0
**********

there is a new DB-independent Datasource::exec() syntax (although so far only
the Oracle driver has been modified to support it).  In Oracle *LOB columns
are supported for binding and passing values through ::exec().  The syntax is
somewhat similar to *printf() except %v is used for all value types:
For example, to bind values in a generic SQL statement:
$ds.exec("insert into table values ( %v, %v, %v, %v, %v, %v )", binary($data),
"string", 12345, True, now(), 1.43);
for Oracle, values are bound as follows:
        Type::Binary   = SQLT_BIN  (can be a BLOB for example)
        Type::String   = SQLT_STR
        Type::Integer  = SQLT_INT or SQLT_STR  (int > 32-bits = SQLT_STR, <=
	32-bit int = SQLT_INT)
        Type::Boolean  = SQLT_INT  (1 or 0)
        Type::Float    = SQLT_FLT
        Type::Date     = SQLT_DAT

attempts to bind other types will result in a run-time exception.

To retrieve values from a stored procedure or function, you must specify
placeholder with a syntax more similar to Oracle's as follows:
$hash = $ds.exec(begin stored_procedure_name('Literal String', :param1,
:param2, param3); end;");

The placeholders are the :param* elements in the string, and will correspond
to the keys in the result hash (without the leading ':' character).  If no
types are defined by arguments following the string, then they default to
strings with a maximum length of 512 bytes.  To retrieve other types or longer
string values using placeholders, you have to include arguments after the
string, one argument for each placeholder.  The arguments should be the data
type for the bind as follows:
        Type::Binary  = BLOB
        "clob"        = CLOB
        Type::String  = SQLT_STR
        Type::Integer = SQLT_INT  (returns a 32 bit integer)
        Type::Float   = SQLT_FLT
        Type::Date    = SQLT_DAT
        Type::Hash    = SQLT_RSET (for result sets, stored procs that return
	cursors, etc)

This new syntax is meant to be driver-independent, so, for example, when the
MySQL driver is updated to take advantage of MySQL 5.0 features like stored
procedure execution, support for this syntax will be implemented as well.


**********
Qore 0.4.2
**********

the 128K limit for CLOBs is now gone and BLOBs will now be selected as binary
objects.  However I have found what I believe is a bug in Oracle 9i where even
if you are trying to stream CLOB data you have to allocate a buffer bigger
than the CLOB you are trying to stream or you will get an "ORA-24812:
character set conversion to or from UCS2 failed" error (I saw this on Saolaris
with a 9i client and 9i server), to change the buffer size in
modules/oracle/oracle.h with the LOB_BLOCK_SIZE define (currently it's set at
32K as a compromise - not ideal for working streaming like with 10g, but
medium large for the broken versions...)
